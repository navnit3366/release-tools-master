The files here are not in a particularly usable state.
They assume that you have a directory called
	/home/larry/src/python/3.4
which is a checkout of Python trunk with a named branch
called "3.4" (starting at revision e64ae8b82672).

However, they do document the process used for making
3.4.0 rc2 and 3.4.0 final, and should be a good starting
point for a more general-purpose (and less hacked-up) tool.
